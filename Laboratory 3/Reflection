(Out of all the designs I found the square post the easiest,
 I took a quote from one of my favorite authors Terry Pratchett
 in his book  A Hat Full of Sky. I chose this quote because it
 emphasizes the idea that narratives change people and societies 
 and I applied the same themes as before circles and arcs, however 
 I add some unique elements to some of the designs to better align
 their purposes while I tried not to break away from my branding, 
 I ensured that the important elements had center stage with clear 
 formatting and adherence to the( C.R.A.P) method. Here I learned
 that social media graphic had to be eye catching but it also had 
 to send a message too and it's the designer job to balance that)
