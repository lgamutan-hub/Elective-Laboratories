("As I was making the presentation, I found the use of repetition to be the most useful principle,
because it gave my design an identity and is easy to incorporate, as you simply need to decide on a
consistent identity for your presentation. While I found that the picking of that whole design 
identity is the most difficult step as you are burdened with many choices, such as your color palette 
and little designs to permeate across my projects. However I learned that when trying to communicate
something through a visual medium you have to give them enough to present the idea but not overwhelm
them with an abundance of design.)
