(When I was creating my branding, I wanted something formal and not too overwhelming,
so I chose more muted blueish colours alongside splashes of white and light blue.
I chose blue because it's one of my favourite colors. It's not as harsh as red or orange
but not as boring as green or grey. I kept that in mind when I was creating my logo, 
I wanted to play with circles and arcs, but that came with the challenge of making it 
interesting and unique. Eventually, I decided on a circle wrapped by two snake-like arrows.
I am planning to use my branding to continue my theme of circles and arcs, like a sort of 
signature, and of course, if there are opportunities where I need to create a presentation,
I have a foundation to work on.)
